            <p>This is story all about how I decided to become a developer. I really enjoy computers and what they allow us to create. The task they can accomplish in short periods of time. I just want to be able to create things myself and so i decided to learn how to code. It wasn't until years later I actual enrolled into a bootcamp called coding temple and now we are here.</p>
